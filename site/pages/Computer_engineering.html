        <h1 class="headings h18">2. Manufacturing Engineer</h1>
        <p id="text40">
            A manufacturing engineer is a professional who applies engineering principles to the design and production of manufactured products. This includes the development of new processes and products, as well as the improvement of existing ones.
            The role of a manufacturing engineer is to ensure that the manufacturing process is efficient and effective. They achieve this by designing and overseeing the construction of equipment and machinery, as well as developing new methods of production. Manufacturing engineers also work closely with other professionals, such as quality control engineers and supply chain managers, to ensure that products meet customer expectations.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/Computer engineering/manuf eng.jpg" id="img26">
        <p id="text41">For example, industrial robots are used in factories to automate repetitive tasks. These robots require people with engineering and programming skills. or Service robots are designed to help people with everyday tasks such as cleaning or transportation. These both robots require technical skills in electronics and programming which computer engineers are excelling.</p>

        <h1 class="headings h18" id="h19">3.  Quality Assurance Engineer</h1>
        <img src="../images/Computer engineering/qual eng.jpg" id="img27">
        <p id="text42">            
            As technology advances, so does the demand for better quality assurance within the engineering field. A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring that products meet minimum standards of quality and performance. They develop and implement testing plans, track and analyze defects, and work with teams to resolve issues.
            There are many computer engineers who work in quality engineering for robotics companies. Robotics companies often need computer engineers to help with the development and testing of their products. Computer engineers can also help to develop new robotic technologies.
        </p>
        <p id="text43">Computer engineers working in quality engineering for robotics companies typically develop and test software for robots. They may also design robot controllers and interface systems. In some cases, computer engineers may also be involved in developing new robotic technologies.</p>

      <div style="margin-top: 163vw;">
        <h1 class="headings h18"> 4. Project Manager</h1>
        <p id="text44">
A project manager is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers have the responsibility for the planning, execution, and closing of any project, typically relating to construction. A project manager is a person who coordinates and controls resources and schedules to achieve specific goals.
The role of a project manager includes being able to motivate team members, identify risks and issues early on, and keep the project on track despite setbacks. Strong communication skills are essential, as well as the ability to work with people from different departments within an organization.
